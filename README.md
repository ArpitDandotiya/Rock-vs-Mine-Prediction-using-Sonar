# Sonar Mine Machine Learning Project
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting underwater mines using sonar data. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can differentiate between mines and other underwater objects based on sonar readings.

Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled sonar readings collected from underwater environments. The data is divided into a training set and a test set.

Model Development
The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, training, evaluation, and optimization.

Repository Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project.
models/: Contains trained machine learning models.
scripts/: Contains additional scripts and utility functions.
Requirements
The project requires standard machine learning libraries and tools.

Feel free to explore the code and notebooks for more details on the project implementation
